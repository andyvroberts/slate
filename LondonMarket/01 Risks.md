## Risk
The possiblity of loss.  Something that can be subject to a fortuitous (unfortunate) event and where there is an insurable interest (ownership or responsibility).  
A risk can be insured to protect against possible loss, or in other words, to transfer some of the risk to a third party in exchange for a premium.

Examples:  
A Property: insured against accidental damange or destruction.  
A Company: being subject to one or more forms of litigation.

#### Risk Type
The name given to a specific risk with is eligible for the *Risk Transfer Mechanism* of insurance.  

Examples:  
A Property: Flood damange, Fire, Accidental damange.  
A Company: Business interruption, Legal liability.  

#### Risk Level
A non-scientific measure used to categorise risks in order to sort or group them appropriately for reporting or analytics.  Risk level is the parent term for the combination of Risk Frequency and Risk Severity.  

A risk with a high frequency and a high severity is more costly than a risk with a low frequency and low severity.   
Notes: See the Heinrich/Bird triangles.  

Examples:  
High, Medium or Low (an estimated financial exposure level). 

#### Risk Frequency
How often a particular risk may happen.  The frequency may be categorised as high (very likely), medium (occasionally) or low (unlikely) as long as these values can be interpreted into some more meaningful measure.  

Example:  
Flooding of a property is expected to occur every 5 years on average.  

#### Risk Severity  
A measure of the amount of predicted loss, damange or destruction that may be accepted if the risk occurs.  The higher the risk, the higher the potential loss.  

Example:  
Buildings further away from a potentially flooding water source will be less severe.

#### Predicted Loss
A monetary value that may be paid out if a successful claim is made for a risk.  The predicted loss is essential for the calculation of financial exposure.  
Insurers calculate premiums on the assessment of risk-based factors relating to both frequency and severity.  

Example:   
A building may be insured for Â£1 million in case of flooding.
