# Glossary

### Compulsory Insurance  
Some types of insurance are mandated through either governaments or regulatory bodies.  
For example, car insurance, employers liability.

### Equitable Premium
Pooling systems for each main risk grouping (e.g. Marine, Aviation Hull, Property, etc.) are comprised of many premium contributions.  
The insurer must decide on an equitable contribution for each insured risk in the pool, by taking into account varying elements, known as *discrimination factors*.  

The discrimination factors result in a premium that allows the insurer to cover its costs and make a profit.  

### Financial Risk (risk category)
A risk where the outcome of an adverse event can be measured in financial terms.  
For example, theft of property, loss of business profits following a fire, and legal liabilty in the case of personal injury compensation, etc.

### Fortuitous Event (risk feature)
A risk event must be accidental or unexptected, and not inevitable.  Also, it must not be deliberate on the part of the insured.  

### Frequency
How often a risk may happen.  

### Fundamental Risk (risk category)
Uninsurable risks that arise from social, economic, political or natural causes and are widespread in their effect.  
Or, events that occur on such a vast scale that they are uninsurable.  For example, economic recession, famine, war, etc.  

### Hazard
A hazard influences the operation or effect of a peril.   
For example, a werehouse fire is a peril.  But the fact that sprinklers are not installed is a hazard which means that the fire has a greater effect.  

With regard to a Peril, examples of the hazards that can be linked with them are:
| Peril | Hazard |
|--|--|
|Explosion | smoking is permitted near flamable materials |
|Lightening | inadequate lightening conductors on buildings |
|Collision | lack of driver training or non-visible speed limit signage |
|Dishonesty |  poor security or operational controls to prevent theft |

### Homogenous Exposure (risk feature)
Historical patterns and trends of similar exposures and risks enable insurers to forecast (see the law of large numbers) the expected extent of future losses.  
  
Whereas a fortuitous event, insurable interest and not being against public policy are absolute requirements as risk features, a Homogenous Exposure is only an ideal.  

### Insurable Interest (risk feature)
The legally recognised financial relationship between the insured and the object or liability.  
For example, it is only possible for you to insure your own car, and not a car belonging to another.

### Insurance
|Function |Benefit |
|-|-|
|Primary |Spread risk between the insured, insurance companies and reinsurance companies. |
|Primary |Provide a degree of certainty in exchange for a premium payment. |
|Primary |Transfer or risk.  An insurer will accept financial risk and charge a premium in return. |
|Secondary |No need to set aside large sums of money for dealing with losses. |
|Secondary |Provides the confidence for companies to expand their businesses. |
|Secondary |Job protection through compensation in the event of an unfortunate event. |
|Secondary |Financial losses are reduced in size and number. |
|Secondary |Premium reserves (the accumulation of premiums) held by insurers means they can be investors of funds. |

### Law or Large Numbers
When operating a pool, insurers benefit (rely on) the law of large numbers.  
The law states that given a large number of similar situations, the actual number of events occuring tends towards the expected number.  

Applying this statistical law to insurance, enables the insurer to confidently predict the final cost of claims within a given (underwriting) year.  

### Moral Hazard
Arises from the attitude and behaviour of people.  
For example, careless or lax management in a factory represents poor moral hazard.  

### Non-Financial Risk (risk category)
Where a risk cannot be measured only in financial terms.  For example, sentimental value cannot be insured (although the market value can be).

### Particular Risk (risk category)
Particular risks are localised or personal in their cause and effect.  
Even if the cause is sometimes widespread, in the case of a storm within a region, the effect is usually localised to an individual (the region cannot be insured, but a house can).  
For example, a factory fire, a car collision, theft of personal possessions, etc.   

### Peril
If a risk event occurs, a peril may give rise to a loss.  
For example, a fire, flood, explosion, lightening, collision, dishonesty.  
However, perils may be named as a cause, but in the majority, a peril does not result in a loss as claims are not made by the every insured in a pool.  

### Physical Hazard
The physical characteristics of a risk that includes any measurable dimension.  The characteristics can increase or decrease the possibilty of a peril.  
For example, property construction quality, age of car drivers.  

### Pooling of Risk
The losses of a few insured clients who suffer misfortune are covered by the contributions of the many insured clients who, although exposed to similar risks, do not need to make a claim.  

An insurer who gathers many small individual sums of money from those who want to be pretected from similar kinds of perils, sets itself up to operate a pool.  Insureres operate many separate pools for each different class of insurance they underwrite.  

### Public Policy (risk feature)
An insurer must not cover risks that are against public policy.  
For example, the risk of incurring a fine for a criminal offence is uninsurable.  

### Pure Risk (risk category)
Where there is the possiblity of a loss, but not of a gain.  For example, risk of fire, risk of machinary breakdown, risk of employee injury.  

### Risk
There is no universally recognised definition of risk.  It can have many different meanings depending on the context.  However, to be insurable a risk must fall into one of the insurable risk categories and comply with the Risk Features.  

|Is Insurable |Risk Category |
|-|-|
|Yes |Financial
|Yes |Pure |
|Yes |Particular |
|No |Non-Financial |
|No |Speculative |
|No |Fundamental | 


All *insurable* risks must also have the following Risk Features:  
A Fortuitous Event.  
An Insurable Interest.  
A risk that is not against public policy.   
A Homogenous Exposure, i.e. not a one-off.  

### Risk Category
Only Financial, Pure and Particular risk can be insured.  
Non-Financial, Speculative and Fundamental risks cannot be insured.

### Risk Management
The identification, analysis and economic control of defined risks which can threaten assets or earning capacity.   

### Risk Transfer
The process of insurance.  Where a third party assumes the financial consequences of a risk occuring.

### Service Industry


### Severity
The seriousness of the consequences when a risk occurs.  Usually measured as a financial value.  

### Speculative Risk (risk cateory)
Speculation with the intent of making a financial gain cannot be insured.  
For example, investments, gambling, starting a business, etc.  

### Uncertainty
